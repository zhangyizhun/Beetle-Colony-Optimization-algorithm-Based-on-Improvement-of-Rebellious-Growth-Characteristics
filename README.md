# Beetle-Colony-Optimization-algorithm-Based-on-Improvement-of-Rebellious-Growth-Characteristics
We propose a Rebellious Growth Personality–Beetle Swarm Optimization (RGP–BSO) algorithm, which introduces growth and rebellious traits, an adaptive selection strategy, and dynamic factors to balance global and local search.  This improves optimization, prevents local optima, and accelerates convergence.
